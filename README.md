# Logic Reading Group 2020

**Meetings**:
10am every other Wednesday beginning June 24th.

**Overview**:
This is the Github repository of the logic reading group at the UPenn CIS department, Summer 2020. We are working on solutions to *Logic and Structure* by Dirk van Dalen. The goal of this group is to build a strong foundation in the traditional four areas of logic: model theory, proof theory, recursion theory, and (to some extent) set theory.

**Homework**:
For each meeting you will be assigned specific questions. You should typeset these questions and upload solutions to Github before the meeting. You will also be asked to solve (on your own) a certain number of other questions. At the meetings, we will discuss problems we found particularly interesting, challenging, or enlightening.

The Google Doc will always have the latest information about your assigned questions.
